# Design notebook for week ending November 2, 2014

## Description

I have spent much of this week thinking about my design and planning how my language will work. I want superscripted text to be higher in pitch than the pitch before and subscripted text to be lower in pitch than the pitch before it. As for how to tell if something is a new note, if it is of a different pitch or if there is space between the characters, they are different notes. Also, when people sing, they tend to elongate notes on the vowels, so that's what I plan to do with my language. I will determine the length of a note based on consecutive repeated vowels. Louder notes will be in bigger fonts. Sample programs are in the sample programs folder in my project repository. I've also started looking at how to produce MIDI output in different languages.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

I need to decide on a host language before I can make progress on anything else. This means looking into what options there are for things like parser combinators in other languages, as well as what tools are available for creating musical output.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

Are there any obvious flaws in my design as it is currently, or any potential pitfalls you see that I could possibly avoid now with careful planning or should watch for as I code? Are there any tools or libraries that you know of that I should look into for my project?

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

I spent about 7 hours on my project this week.
