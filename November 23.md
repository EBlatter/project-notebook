# Design notebook for week ending November 23, 2014

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

## Post-critique summary

Sisi said that I should think about how different things are represented within a note, and advised that it's usually easier to deal with things in the interpreter than the parser. She also suggested I work out how easy it is to get pitches from Excel to match music output. Also, because the designing part of this has taken me longer than expected, I may want to rethink my schedule and goals.


## Post-critique reflection

This week, I need to get started on actually coding things. I would still like my prototype to be able to deal with different pitches, and so this should allow me to be able to start testing and tweaking how the semantics deal with different positions of notes in the spreadsheet.
